# Vatom Spaces: Simple Start ðŸ”Œ

This plugin is designed to be used from within [Vatom Spaces](https://vatom.com). Adds extra options to the File > Settings > Welcome Screen list. This replacement start screen shows a simple loading bar, and then enters the space immediately.

## Development

- Ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Login to the Vatom CLI with `npm run login`
- Build and load the plugin into your space with `npm run sideload -- myspace` (replace `myspace` with your space alias name)
- When ready, publish to the Marketplace with `npm run publish`

> **Note:** You can only sideload plugins in a space you are the owner of.
